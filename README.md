# Link Shortener

This is a simple, no-frills link shortener. It's a single page app that uses a database to shorten URLs.

## Features

- Shorten URLs
- Manage shortened URLs

That's it! No tracking, no analytics, no ads, no cookies, no tracking pixels, no GDPR consent forms, no dark patterns, no bullshit.

## Inspiration

I wanted to create a simple link shortener that I could use for my own projects. I didn't want to use a third-party service because I didn't want to be dependent on them. I also didn't want to use a service that would track my users or show them ads. So I decided to build my own.
